- CommandFields are ICommands is good.  MouseCommands taking MainGame as parameters 
- Update loop is sensible.  Doesn't rely on more than mario (which the controller needs to know
about because it's controlling mario.)  Expanding to allow the mouse to control a menu would require
making a new MenuMouseController.  Since a MenuMouseController would require new commands anyway, a
second MouseController file isn't a high cost.
- MouseControlToggle should be renamed to IsMouseEnabled (makes a more readable boolean flag).
- Commented function should be removed.
- Indentation and blank lines affect readability.
