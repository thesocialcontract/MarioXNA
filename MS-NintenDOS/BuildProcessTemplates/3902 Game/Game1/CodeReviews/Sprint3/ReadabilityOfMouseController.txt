Sprint #: 3
Name of File: MouseController.cs
Author of File: Johnny Albaugh
Time Taken: 10 min

Naming: Decent
- Command variable names are good (MouseUpCommand, etc.)
- ToggleOnOrOff could potentially be shortened to ToggleOnOff without hurting legibility
- "MouseContollerToggle" variable does not descrie which state is which. Maybe change it to like MouseIsOn.

Explaining what is happening: Good
- Logical flow makes sense, its easy to see what is happening
	throughout update and draw.

WhiteSpace:
- Make whitespace consistent (different members have a different number of empty lines before and after)
