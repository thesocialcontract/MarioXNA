Comments:
	- The file only relies on the ICollider interface, each of the CollisionHandlers, and
	the IGameEntity interface which makes the coupling low and is an effective way of 
	organizing the file.
	- The only problem I see is the fact that in the "GetCollisionHandler" method we are checking
	the objects to see if they are one of the types of which we are checking collisions for. This
	requires us to later down the line add more strings for the different kinds of objects that we
	would want handle collisions. On way we can fix this is by loading in the different kinds of 
	objects that we would want to handle collisions for in a file and putting the strings in a list
	and then checking for the correct collision handler using the new collection of collider list.
