The code is relatively straightforward.  I can follow it easily.  This is
a controversial opinion, but I think that when writing one line statements
in an if block, it makes it much more readable to remove the braces, ala

	if (cond)
		thing
	else
		otherthing

The argument for leaving them is to make it look consistent and to prevent
programmers from forgetting to add braces if they need to add a second
statment to the block.  I think that braceless blocks are way easier
to read, and if you're adding a thing, it's formatted so it's hard to
forget that you need to add braces.

SetColliderList() would look cleaner with the one line if blocks.

Another controversial opinion: Comments for logical blocks of code are
a helpful table of contents.  It's much easier to logically separate
what part of the code is doing what with a one line comment that
describes what a complicated section is trying to do.  Update() could
benefit from some one line summaries at lines 44 and 66.  Alternatively
the operations could be stuffed into functions so the functions serve
as the comments.  (e.g.the top section could be "HandleDynamicStationaryCollisions(args)")

InitializeHandlerList() is extremely clean.

DeterminCollisionSide() could be cleaner with the oneline if else blocks.
