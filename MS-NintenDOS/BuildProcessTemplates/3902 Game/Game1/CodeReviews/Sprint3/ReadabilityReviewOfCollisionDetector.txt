Sprint #: 3
Name of File: CollisionDetector.cs
Author of File: Leo Steinkerchner
Time Taken: 15 min

Naming: Decent
	- The class properties do not follow our convention and should be in PascalCase instead of CamelCase
	- At first glance, I think a reader would confused by the name "handlerList". I think that they would
	be confused about what exactly are the handlers handling. In order to make it more descriptive, maybe 
	changing the name to CollisionHandlerList would work.
	- Same thing with the method names. Names like "SetColliderList" and "InitializeHandlerList" do similar
	things and yet have different naming schemes (It would probably be better for them to both be "Initialize"
	rather than "Set").
	
Explaing what is being good: Decent
	- For a class of this length/complexity it might be best to add some comments. While everything makes sense
	to me, I believe another person would have trouble figuring out what exactly is being done, especially in the
	update method.
