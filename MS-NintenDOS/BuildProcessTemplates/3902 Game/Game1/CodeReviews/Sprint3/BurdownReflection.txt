The burdown chart wasn't always updated during development.  Only 4/7 Items 
were marked as Done or InProgress throughout the sprint.  Halfway through the
sprint, items were changed from approved to in progress, resulting in a spike
instead of a consistent downward slope.  Our tasks are done, but because a few
are left marked as TODO or Approved, we still have a small plateau on the
burndown chart.

What we saw was a steep climb at the beginning when we set tasks, a small
descent from a minor feature, a pleateau that no one worked during, a small
ascent when we properly marked some tasks, and a steep descent near the end
of the sprint.  This says we worked on the sprint a bit, but did the bulk of the
work at the end.

Supposing that we correctly marked the tasks, we would see a gradual burndown
until the end of the sprint, where it would drop steeply.  Ideally, the chart
should align with a constant linear slope the entire sprint, implying a small
constant ammount of work each day.  Steps we should take are to spread our work
out so we don't do everything in a small period of time (especially if that time
is near the due date of the sprint).
