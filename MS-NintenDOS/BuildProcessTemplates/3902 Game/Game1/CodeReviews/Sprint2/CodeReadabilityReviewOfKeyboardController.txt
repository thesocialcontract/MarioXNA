KeyboardController.cs

Variable and Method names are all concise yet descriptive.
Logical flow is good, everything makes sense without comments.
If CommandList needs to be public, it should be a property, with getters and setters.
    If not, it should be private and changed to commandList.
There is inconsistent spacing (Constructor has leading and trailing lines, where
    RegisterCommand only has a leading line)
