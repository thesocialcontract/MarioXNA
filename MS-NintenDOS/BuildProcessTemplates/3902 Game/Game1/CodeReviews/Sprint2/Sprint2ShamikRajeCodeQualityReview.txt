I do think that the Mario state files (this one included) are reliant
on the SpriteBatch type when there is no need for them to be. Since 
the purpose of these file are to handle the state of mario and not the
drawing of mario. Especially with the current implementation, the
SpriteBatch is coupled with too many of the other files.

Hypothetical change: 
I think it would be a good idea for the staionary sprite class to handle
not just the animation but rather the drawing as well in the sense that
the Sprite classes are the only ones to know about the SpriteBatch. This
may, however, not be a good idea as then every SINGLE sprite would be 
linked to the TextureFactory singleton. However, it being connected to the
state would mean that the State files would handle things that are a bit
outside its scope.
