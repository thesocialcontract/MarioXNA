Sprint #: 4
Name of File: BlockContent.cs
Author of File: Caleb George
Time Taken: 10 min

Naming: Good
- Going off of what the variable names make me think before reading the code body, most
	of them are good. The ones that I'm not immediately sure about are BumpTime and isTicking,
	so you could consider changing these but it's not absolutely necessary.
- Similarly, eject is intuitive, but ShiftSpawnPosition is not. Just from the name, I don't
	really know what it is for.

Explaining what is happening: Good
- Logical flow makes sense, its easy to see what is happening
	throughout Eject and ShiftSpawnPosition.

WhiteSpace:
- I like the use of whitespace between categories of things (between properties
	and members, members and methods, etc.)
