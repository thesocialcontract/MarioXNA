For the most part, pretty straightforward.

Fireball might be more maintainable if coded as an entirely new entity type such as 
a Particle type instead of an Item type.  That said, unless we were planning on adding
features like guns or other projectile shooters, it wouldn't be helpful to code it
like that.

The Physics engine should be an IPhysicsEngine type.  Since we only have one physics engine
it doesn't matter in the short term, but if we ever want to change how the physics engine
works under the hood, or prototype a different one (like what we did earlier this sprint)
then it would be more difficult to change all of the concrete implmentations like what we
have her.

I think it might be better to make the explosion timer based on a delta time value instead of a 
per frame value.  The way the explosion timer is written will speed up/slow down with frame
rates, which will vary as hardware inevitably changes.  Though, not as big a deal anymore, as most
computers will run what we have at 60fps.
