Pretty Straight forward for the most part

Animation works for mainly sprites that need to move but don't have
a colider associated with them. It may be more cohesive if it worked 
for animations for collidable objects rather than just non collidables

I can't really think of any significant changes that would improve its
cohesion other than the one above. Considering the fact that all of the
animation code relates to sprites and drawing.
