The file is cohesive.  The functions ApplyForce(), Hit(), Bounce(), and SetVelocity(), give a clear
interaction for physics.  Hit() and Bounce() are useful abstractions for interacting with physics,
but the name Hit isn't intuitive until you dig into the code.  It might be better to name it
HitAndStop() or HitSideAndStop().

In Bounce, it might be easier to read if you removed the brackets for the if statements in the switch
case.  Every nested level adds a little bit to the cognitive load it takes to digest a block of code
so reducing them where possible is helpful.

In Update() It would make sense to add all the forces together, so moving velocity to right before
the damping force calculation.  

The magic numbers could be more readable by putting them in a variable and giving them a descriptive name.
I'm not really sure why the numbers are the way they are, except for the "velocity.X *= -1" lines.  Because
it's negating the direction, it would be obfuscated if you gave it a name.
