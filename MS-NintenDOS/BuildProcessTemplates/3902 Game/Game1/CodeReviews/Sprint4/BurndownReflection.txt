The burndown chart was not always updated during development. However towards
the end of the sprint we began to utilize the board quite a bit more to track
bugs. The resulting graph was a slow rising slope with sharp spikes upward
before the the sprint deadlines. Our tasks are done but a few are left marked as
TODO or approved.

What we saw was a steep climb at the beginning when we set tasks, a small
plateau where nobody edited their work, a sharp decline before the first 
deadline, a larger plateau during spring break, and then asharp decline before
the second deadline.

Supposing that we correctly marked the tasks, we would see a gradual burndown
until the end of the sprint. Ideally, the chart should align with a constant
linear slope the entire sprint, implying a small constant ammount of work each 
day.  Steps we should take are to spread our work out so we don't do everything
in a small period of time (especially if that time is near the due date of the
sprint).
