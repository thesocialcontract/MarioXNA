Cohesion: Good
	All of the parts of this class are related to managing the sound effects and the
	music. I especially like the fact that the file location of all of the sounds and
	music are abstracted to the AudioConstants.cs file. It makes things more readable 
	easier to understand

Coupling: Very Good
	AudioManager does not rely on anything except for the AudioConstants.cs class, and
	MedioPlayer. 

Hypothetical Change:
	I think it would be beneficial to separate the sound effects and the music.
	By doing so the classes would be more cohesesive and easier to understand. The
	current AudioManager class is rather lenghthy. Even though all of the methods are
	"one liners", separating the music from the sound efects into say SFXManager and
	BGMManager would be good in the long run if we decide to add more music and SFX.
	THis shouldn't be too difficult of a change either.
