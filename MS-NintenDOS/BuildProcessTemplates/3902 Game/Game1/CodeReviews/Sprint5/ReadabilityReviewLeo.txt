Naming: Great
- Before reading the code, the variable names are descriptive and already give
	me an idea of what is happening.
- Similarly, all of the method names are clear and concise.

Explaining what is happening: Great
- The logical flow of all of the methods is clear, and with the
	strong variable names its obvious what is happening at each step.

WhiteSpace:
- I like the use of whitespace between categories of things (between properties
	and members, members and methods, etc.)
- You could condence the constructor, so it doesn't take up as much space

Other:
- You could potentially reorder the methods. In most of our classes, the last
	two methods are Update and Draw, and it's a little bit easier to find them
	if they're consistently at the bottom.
