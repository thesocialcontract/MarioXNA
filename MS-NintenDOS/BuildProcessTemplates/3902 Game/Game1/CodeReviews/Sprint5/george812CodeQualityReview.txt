Time Taken: 10 min

Cohesion: Communicational (Decent)
    All parts of this class are related to managing the behavior of Scenes. The Functions
    are intuitively named, and sufficiently succinct.  However, the scenes are supposed
    to be a sort of transitional display.  Seeing as there's only one transition, it might
    make more sense to make it a game state or to rename a scene as transitional display.
    Additionally, the MarioLives field is impleneted from IScene, which implies that a scene
    must have some notion of Mario.

Coupling: (Poor)
    Transition scene requires intricate knowledge of Game, and the PlayersHud, and the World
    object.

Length of methods: (Good)
    Methods are short and to the point.

Hypothetical Change: 
    If we needed to add more content to the scene, there isn't an easy way to do that.  We'd 
    have to define more displays in the Hud that the scene uses to draw to the screen, and
    we'd have to add more fields to pass to that Hud.  It's tightly coupled, and its IScene
    is concerned with TransitionScene's specific logic.
