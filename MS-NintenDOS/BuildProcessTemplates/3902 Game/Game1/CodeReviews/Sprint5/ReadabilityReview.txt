I do have a few concerns with readability. I think that you should add the 
curly braces to the for each loops. It makes it harder to tell when the loop
starts and when it stops without them. Also the line directly superceding those
for each loops is right next to the indented line making it rather confusing.

Other than that it looks pretty cohesive. The world state only controls what the
world state needs to control, except for the game ending. When Mario dies currently
the PlayingWorldState (for lack of a better term) "has its roots" pretty deep in terms
of the control of the level resetting. Maybe a better way to go about it would be to 
have a command that controls all of the level resetting and offload that logic
to the command.
