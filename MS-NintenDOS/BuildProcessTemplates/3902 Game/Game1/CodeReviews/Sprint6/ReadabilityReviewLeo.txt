Sprint #: 6
Name of File: WorldGenerator.cs
Author of File: Caleb George
Time Taken: 15 min

Naming: Great
- By itself, its not immediately obvious what "chunks" is. I would recommend adding a header that says something
	like "Generates worlds using pre-defined 'chunks'", or making this name more descriptive.
- Methods are all well-named and clear.
- Most instance variables are well-named and make it obvious what they're for.

Explaining what is happening: Great
- I would extract player creation to an AddPlayer method, to make it match the rest of the LoadLevel() steps.
- The logical flow of the methods is great, and easy to follow.

WhiteSpace:
- Good use of whitespace between sections.
- I would add a separator between the chunks definition and the following methods.
