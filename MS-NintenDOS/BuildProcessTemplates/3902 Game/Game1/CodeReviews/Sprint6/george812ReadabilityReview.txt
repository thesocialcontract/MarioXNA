Naming: Great
- Function names imply their exact beahvior except for Enter(string key).
- Enter(string key) could imply pressing a 'submit' key.  I would rename it
    to PressKey(string key).

Explaining what is happening: Great
- The logical flow of all of the methods is clear, and with the
	strong variable names its obvious what is happening at each step.

WhiteSpace:
- Whitespace is consistent.  Good conceptual spacing between concerns.

Other:
- Bookmark Comments are controversial since you have to maintain your comments
    as well as code, but they're easier to sort through summaries than it is to
    read code.  The "// Cheat # - Cheat Description" comments are nice bookmarks
    but the Cheat - # part aren't really necessary.  It's arguable for 2 line
    operations the comments might not be necessary, but I think they're still
    way easier to parse than finding the specific command.
- Braces for one line ifs are controversial.  I think for one liners,
    leaving braces off reduces cognitive load when looking at code flow.
   
   For example:

       public Braces() 
       {
            if (NeedsChecked) 
            {
                DoThing();
            }
            else 
            {
                DoOtherThing();
            }
       }

   Compared to:
    
        public NoBraces()
        {
            if (NeedsChecked)
                DoThing();
            else
                DoOtherThing();
        }

   It takes a little bit of extra time to parse what's actually in the braces.
   Since One-liners like that are conceptually similar, it's easier to understand
   the conceptual block when the lines are spatially similar.
