I think this file is very readable. Bits of code are encapsulated into 
appropriate methods making things very easy to understand. One thing I
am confused about is the fact that register cheats is a private method.
Personally I think that it should be public and other classes can add or
subtract cheats however if you did it this way it would increase coupling.
Also I am unsure as to why the cheats are an array of strings rather than
a string itself or an array of characters or even an array of keys. I would
think that an Array of keys would be much easierto check against, but I
don't know.

Other than those changes I think that what you have is very good. The 
variables are cohesive and the methods are readable. Good work.
