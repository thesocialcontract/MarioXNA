Cohesion: OK
	This class handles everything related to wario and only wario
	however there are things that coould be offloaded to other
	classes/place that would make the code more cohesive. For
	example, the physics constants could go in their own physics
	constants static class. Also the calculate movement function
	could be strictly in the physics class.

Coupling: Good
	Everything that Wario is coupled to are things that wario needs
	except for the fireball generator. That should be something that
	is exclusive to Mario and not Wario. Also there are a few proper-
	ties that can be private that aren't such as MaxRunSpeed.

Length of Methods: Good
	The longest method is calculate movement which, even if it were
	put in the physics class itself, the method would be just as long

Hypothetical Change:
	I think it would be a good idea if we put more stuff in the Player
	abstract class. If we did this it would reduce the clutter of the
	class and make both Wario and Mario more readable and cohesive. we
	can leave things like the power-ups and such to the IMario interface
	and the states.
